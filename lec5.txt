there is a structure to keep the ap.js file we dont keep the all the file in the app.js itself

-> by the the industry standards we keep the files files in diffrent files and folders

-> there are two types of import and export(default and by using export keyword before the name of the variable)

default export and import:-

export default componenet
import from path;


named export and import:-

export const component
 import {component} from path;

-> we were taking data from res list the by using map we mapped all the res data to the resturant card function then it goes
   to applayout function 

   -> if we want to show the resturant above 4 star rating then we can change the reslist by the filter function the reslist changes 
   but it does'nt renders it renders the same unchanged res list on the ui 
   - basically all the framewprks like vue and angular trying to do is if interlink data and ui as the the data cganges the ui because its
   a config driven uo

   -> here comes the state varible of react the use state varible whch is imported from react as a named import

  -> the powerful funtionalities of rect is that it syncs the data layer with he ui layer by 
     the hooks/state variable a.k.a suprer powerfull variable

  -> whenever a sate variable updates react renders its components

   ->react makes the dom manupulation very fast 
    also makes it happen in few lines of code as compared to javascript
   
->                                          Reconcilation algorithm   
          
              res container                                                     res container
                  ↓                                                                   ↓
                7cards                        to --->                           3 cards (filtering)



                here we create virtual-dom not actual dom the actual dom is the body which is the elements the body is an
                object as we can see if we console, as the react.createElement{h1, , }  it creates a react element which is js object 
                which all are virtual dom which is a representation of actual dom whch is not the actual dom.


->                                          Diff algorithm   

              res container                     |                                res container
                  ↓                             |                                      ↓
                7cards                          |                          3 cards (filtering)
                  |                             |
            old virlual dom                    -->                             new virlual dom

             

                      the diff algorithm checs for the from the old to new virlual dom which basically
                      is of 4 nodes the it calculates the diffrence then it actually updates the dom

                react fiber  came in react 16 which has a new of finding the diff and updating the dom

                react finds the diff and updates the dom
