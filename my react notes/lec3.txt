1-> React is is called react because it reacts with 
    the dom eleemnts (the dom elements are the elements of the the html like body , dive n all)

2-> react.createElement - has to be given three parameters fist the the element which we want to create like h1 and 2nd args is in this 
    {} which an object as an attribute of the tag like id    

3-> react.createElement is an  => js object , and when we render it to the dom it becomes =>html element
    
4 ->    root.render does not appends it replaces everything

5 -> jsx is html like syntax not html in js

6-> jsx code is transpiled to js object by parcel through babel which is a js compiler then the code is 
    coverted to js then it goos to render & then it works

7-> when we console the jsx heading (const jsxheading = <h1> this is namaste react </h1>) and react.create 
    they both are same how ? 
    ans:-
    -> jsx is converted to js object babel and React.createElement is a js object

8-> if we have to give attribute in jsx we have to give in camel case    

9-> there are two types of react functional component(new) and class based componenet(old)
    the functional componenet is a normal js function which returns jsx code.

10-> we render funtional component by < /> for babel to understand.

11-> in jsx javascript code be written in these brackets{} it is so helpful.
